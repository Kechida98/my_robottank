## Prototype1
In prototype 1 I tried to to run one dc motor to see if it works good runing it forward and backward with pulse with modulation=pwm.

Components used in Prototype 1:

MCU: ESP32-C6/ will be changed to esp32 wroom 32e for bluedroid/bluetooth classic later
Motor Driver: L298N
Power: 2x 3.7V Li-ion batteries with holder
DC Motor with plastic wheel
Jumper cables
Motor A was tested for forward and backward movement using PWM.
Picture below.

Picture one:
