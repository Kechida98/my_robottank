## Prototype 1
In prototype 1 I tried to to run one dc motor to see if it works good runing it forward and backward with pulse with modulation=pwm.

Components used in Prototype 1:

MCU: ESP32-C6/ will be changed to esp32 wroom 32e for bluedroid/bluetooth classic later. Because Esp32-C6 is only compatible with BLE = Bluetooth low energy and wroom can do both.
Motor Driver: L298N
Power: 2x 3.7V Li-ion batteries with holder
DC Motor with plastic wheel
Jumper cables
Motor A was tested for forward and backward movement using PWM.

## Prototype 2
In Prototype 2, I focused on running two DC motors simultaneously to test synchronized motion â€” making sure they start and stop together properly.

I also bought the kit chassi to improve structure, stability, and overall design. Well it was either build my own chassi, wich i would do if i had a 3d printer or material to craft one. This helps with both functionality and future expansion (like mounting sensors, battery, and ESP board).
